# Bootstrap Grid Practice  

## Overview  
This project is a **Bootstrap Grid Practice Activity** where students will create a **responsive profile card layout** using Bootstrap 5.3. The goal is to understand how the Bootstrap grid system works and how to adjust layouts for different screen sizes.  

## Learning Objectives  
- Understand how Bootstrap's **grid system** works (rows, columns, and breakpoints).  
- Learn how to create a **responsive** webpage using `col-`, `col-sm-`, and `col-md-` classes.  
- Practice using Bootstrap components like **cards, buttons, and utility classes**.  

## Setup Instructions  
1. Download or copy the provided `index.html` file.  
2. Open the file in a web browser (Chrome, Edge, or Firefox).  
3. Resize the browser window to see how the layout adjusts.  
4. Modify the grid structure and Bootstrap classes to experiment with responsiveness.  

## Student Tasks  
1. Open the `index.html` file and run it in a browser.  
2. Resize the window and observe how the cards adjust.  
3. Modify the layout:  
   - Change `col-md-4` to `col-lg-3` or `col-sm-12` and see what happens.  
   - Add another profile card using the same structure.  
4. Customize the design:  
   - Change card background colors using Bootstrap classes (`bg-primary`, `bg-warning`, etc.).  
   - Add a Bootstrap button inside each card (e.g., `<button class="btn btn-primary">View Profile</button>`).  
5. Share and reflect:  
   - What happens when the screen size changes?  
   - How does Bootstrap's grid system help with responsive design?  

## Extra Challenge  
- Try adding an **image or icon** inside each card using Bootstrap utilities.  
- Experiment with different column widths (`col-lg`, `col-xl`) for more control over layouts.
